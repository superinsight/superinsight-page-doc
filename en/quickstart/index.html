<h1 id="quickstart">Quickstart</h1>
<p>This is a quickstart guide on how to use Superinsight ML database to perform ML operations using SQL query.
You will learn how to create a database table and insert data into your table.
Finally you will be able to run a semantic search using SQL query. It's that simple.
If you don't have an account yet, sign up to <a href="https://www.superinsight.ai/request-a-demo">get early access</a> here.</p>
<h2 id="1-installation">1. Installation</h2>
<p>We have the standalone and cluster verison of Superinsight. To get started we recommend you use our standalone version in a non-production environment.
When you are ready to move to a production environment, we recommend the distributed version which will give you much better scalability when runnin in kubernetes.</p>
<div class="tabbed-set tabbed-alternate" data-tabs="1:2"><input checked="checked" id="__tabbed_1_1" name="__tabbed_1" type="radio" /><input id="__tabbed_1_2" name="__tabbed_1" type="radio" /><div class="tabbed-labels"><label for="__tabbed_1_1">Standalone Version</label><label for="__tabbed_1_2">Distributed Version</label></div>
<div class="tabbed-content">
<div class="tabbed-block">
<p>For the standalone version, you can run it using a simple docker command.
Don't forget to change the username and password.
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>docker run --name superinsight-db-standalone -p 5432:5432 -e SUPERINSIGHT_USER=admin -e SUPERINSIGHT_PASSWORD=password superinsight/superinsight-db-standalone:latest
</code></pre></div></p>
</div>
<div class="tabbed-block">
<p>For the distributed version, please reach out to the our <a href="https://www.superinsight.ai/get-early-access">Support Team</a></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="2-connect-using-a-database-client">2. Connect using a database client</h2>
<p>After you installation has been completed, you will need a database client to connect to your database on port 5432 via the Postgres Protocol. We recommend using <a href="https://dbeaver.io">DBeaver</a> or <a href="https://www.pgadmin.org">pgAdmin</a></p>
<h2 id="3-create-a-database-table">3. Create a database table</h2>
<p>Database table can be created using the <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statement in superinsight. For the columns that you will like to enable semantic search, assign them with the data type <code>TEXT</code>.
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>CREATE TABLE mldb.movie (
    _id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT,
    genre TEXT,
    overview TEXT,
    released_year varchar(100),
    runtime varchar(100),
    imdb_rating float8,
    director varchar(100),
    no_of_votes int4
);
</code></pre></div></p>
<h2 id="4-insert-data-to-database-table">4. Insert data to database table</h2>
<p>Rows can be inserted to the database using the <code>INSERT</code> statement in superinsight.</p>
<div class="tabbed-set tabbed-alternate" data-tabs="2:2"><input checked="checked" id="__tabbed_2_1" name="__tabbed_2" type="radio" /><input id="__tabbed_2_2" name="__tabbed_2" type="radio" /><div class="tabbed-labels"><label for="__tabbed_2_1">Small Batch Test</label><label for="__tabbed_2_2">Large Batch Test</label></div>
<div class="tabbed-content">
<div class="tabbed-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>INSERT INTO mldb.movie (title,genre,overview,released_year,runtime,imdb_rating,director,no_of_votes) VALUES
