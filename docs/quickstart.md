# Quickstart
This is a quickstart guide on how to use Superinsight ML database to perform ML operations using SQL query.
You will learn how to create a database table and insert data into your table.
Finally you will be able to run a semantic search using SQL query. It's that simple.
If you don't have an account yet, sign up to [get early access](https://www.superinsight.ai/request-a-demo) here.


## 1. Installation
We have the standalone and cluster verison of Superinsight. To get started we recommend you use our standalone version in a non-production environment.
When you are ready to move to a production environment, we recommend the distributed version which will give you much better scalability when runnin in kubernetes.

=== "Standalone Version"

    For the standalone version, you can run it using a simple docker command.
	Don't forget to change the username and password.
	```
	docker run --name superinsight-db-standalone -p 5432:5432 -e SUPERINSIGHT_USER=admin -e SUPERINSIGHT_PASSWORD=password superinsight/superinsight-db-standalone:latest
	```

=== "Distributed Version"

    For the distributed version, please reach out to the our [Support Team](https://www.superinsight.ai/get-early-access)

## 2. Connect using a database client

After you installation has been completed, you will need a database client to connect to your database on port 5432 via the Postgres Protocol. We recommend using [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io) or [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org)

## 3. Create a database table

Database table can be created using the `CREATE TABLE` statement in superinsight. For the columns that you will like to enable semantic search, assign them with the data type `TEXT`.
```
CREATE TABLE mldb.movie (
	_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
	title TEXT,
	genre TEXT,
	overview TEXT,
	released_year varchar(100),
	runtime varchar(100),
	imdb_rating float8,
	director varchar(100),
	no_of_votes int4
);
```

## 4. Insert data to database table 

Rows can be inserted to the database using the `INSERT` statement in superinsight.
